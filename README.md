Testing the Payroll Income or Document Income flows requires modifying the steps above. Instead of calling "Create Item [Sandbox Only]", go to the Income folder and call "Create User Token", followed by "Initialize User Token for Payroll Income [Sandbox only]", or "Initialize User Token for Bank Income [Sandbox only]" as appropriate, and then finally "Retrieve Payroll Income" or "Retrieve Bank Income".
